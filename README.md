# 🟡 Power BI – Global Sales Performance Dashboard  

### 📘 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **global sales performance** across multiple regions, product categories, and time periods.  
It was developed as part of my BI portfolio to demonstrate how complex datasets can be transformed into **clear, interactive, and decision-ready insights** using Power BI.  

The main objective was to design a **single source of truth** that allows business users to track KPIs, identify opportunities, and take data-driven actions efficiently.  

---

### ⚠️ Business Challenge  
The company struggled to get a consolidated view of global performance.  
Sales data existed in different regions and product files, making it difficult to understand:  
- Which regions were driving revenue  
- Which categories performed best  
- How order efficiency compared across locations  

As a result, leadership teams lacked clarity when planning inventory, forecasting demand, and allocating marketing budgets.  

---

### 💡 Approach  
- Transformed and cleaned raw data using **Power Query**.  
- Built a **relational data model** connecting Orders, Products, and Territories in **Power BI**.  
- Created DAX measures for **Total Due**, **Freight**, **Tax**, and **Order Count**.  
- Designed an interactive dashboard with **filters, slicers, and dynamic tooltips**.  
- Focused on a clean and intuitive layout that blends **high-level KPIs** with **deep-dive insights**.
